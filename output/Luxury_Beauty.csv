I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.

Someone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!

Skip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!

You cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.

I remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!

The pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.

My mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.

As she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her. We love this stuff, and if it came by the gallon, we'd invest in tubs!",The BEST!!,1506643200

Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle! I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste!
My teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!).
I drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!

The mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.

My teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.

I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.

I went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.

I was on my second tube with no problems and ordered a third, when I was ready to use it, it was more than 30 days old.  Amazon normally does not help after 30 days, but in this case they did, but said it was the last time.  Consequently I tested it for a couple of days to be sure it would not split open then went back to finish my last tube.  Then I went back to the tube that tested, within a couple of days the bottom split open.  This tube seems to be a softer consistency which should help, but it does not, it still splits open.  The paste tends to harden and I end up wasting too much to make it worth it.  I did call the manufacturer and they said they could do nothing I had to go back to where I purchased the product.

The first time I used this, I thought I noticed a difference but wasn't sure. Within three days though (I brush twice a day and floss) there was a definite improvement. It's quite noticeable.

I used two tubes to whiten my teeth and then I brushed with Super Smile twice a week or so, to maintain it. My teeth weren't blazing, TV white but they were a far bit whiter than they were. I also used the mouthwash intermittently. I had better results when I switch to a Sonic Care electric tooth brush too. Just an inexpensive model was fine.
