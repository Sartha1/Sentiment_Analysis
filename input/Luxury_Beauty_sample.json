I worked at The Body Shop, Sephora, and MAC. Never had I had a problem with dry/cracked hands; however, my mother did and my beloved almond Body Shop hand cream wasn't enough.\n\nSomeone told me to get this product, so I got the smallest size, just in case. Wish I had bought her this size, as this was now her go-to!\n\nSkip forward over a decade, and I'm pregnant with my 1st and only child. I had the most difficult pregnancy, so I picked up sewing as a stress reliever (plus, I could make my son his own clothes and cloth diapers!) Little did I know that sewing DESTROYS your hands!\n\nYou cannot have a greasy hand cream while sewing, as it'll ruin your fabric. Also, you need fast access to your cream, and twist tops just don't do the job. Lastly, when your fingers, fingernails, cuticles crack and peel, it can snag your fabric and threads, destroying your garment.\n\nI remembered this product and quickly bought the tube. THANK THE LORD I REMEMBERED THIS STUFF!!! Saved my life and fabric!\n\nThe pump is the best price--dollar per ounce--and the most convenient. The smell is great and the product is soaked up by my abused hands in seconds. Never have I ruined a good piece of silk, and rarely do my fingers snag fabric. The only time it does happen is when I forget to moisturize my hands.\n\nMy mom works in electronics and is the lead of production. She files papers all day and sometimes has to handle electronic components to help others. Her hands would crack and bleed from her work. It was painful to look at! Plus, she, too, cannot use greasy products, as that would ruin the electronics.\n\nAs she worked along with C&E Gardner's, her hands became normal once again, no longer embarrassing her.

Not only does it work, but it's so incredibly gentle! I seem to have become sensitive to whitening products, be it toothpaste or otherwise. They all either leave my gums raw, or cause tooth sensitivity. Not so with this toothpaste!\nMy teeth have become blinding white since using. My dentist even asked me what I was using because the difference was so drastic (as I had hoped it would be!).\nI drink red wine, coffee, and I'm an ex-smoker. My teeth were getting a bit yellower as I neared 30 but they are finally white again and they are staying white!\n\nThe mint isn't too strong and doesn't make my eyes water either. Most toothpastes make my mouth feel like it's on fire, but this toothpaste does not.\n\nMy teeth look and feel great. This toothpaste gives my teeth that squeaky clean feeling and my dentist said my enamel doesn't look like it's taking a beating either which is a plus.\n\nI couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.\n\nI went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again. Its been a few weeks and my teeth are blinding white again.\n\nThis is my HG toothpaste and I recommend it to all my friends and family as well. It's pretty amazing stuff.", "summary": "This WORKS!

Then I went back to the tube that tested, within a couple of days the bottom split open.  This tube seems to be a softer consistency which should help, but it does not, it still splits open.

My teeth weren't blazing, TV white but they were a far bit whiter than they were. I also used the mouthwash intermittently. I had better results when I switch to a Sonic Care electric tooth brush too. Just an inexpensive model was fine.  It's been a while and it's time to whiten again so, yeah.

When I was a young child, I had tonsillitis quite often and was given Tetracycline because it was a widely prescribed antibiotic at that time. Unfortunately If you take this drug while you have your baby teeth, your permanent teeth may develop banding stains ranging from yellow to gray in color, and slight to severe in intensity, plus they may become translucent. My teeth developed slight yellow banding and translucency, and after trying many other bleaching and whitening methods (professional and over-the-counter) to no avail, I tried this and it's worked better than anything else. I've been using the toothpaste with accelerator twice a day for about 3 years and my teeth are brighter and more opaque than they've ever been. I'm very pleased with this system.", "summary": "Works well on Tetracycline stains", "unixReviewTime": 1378339200},
